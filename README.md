NextWatch AI is an intelligent movie recommendation system that leverages machine learning and rich movie metadata to suggest films tailored to user preferences. Powered by the TMDB 5000 dataset, this project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze movie content and generate personalized recommendations.

## Features

* **Content-based movie recommendations** using metadata and credits
* Utilizes the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits datasets for robust data
* Interactive interface for querying and displaying recommendations
* Implemented with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and optionally Flask/Streamlit
* Deployment-ready with `Procfile` and setup scripts for easy cloud deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook (to explore `.ipynb` files)
* pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samridhi060/nextwatch-ai.git
   cd nextwatch-ai
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Run the setup script for deployment environment preparation:

   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```

---

## Usage

* To explore or modify the recommendation system logic, open and run:

  ```
  MovieRecommendation.ipynb
  ```

* To start the web application (if `app.py` uses Flask or Streamlit):

  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

* Access the interactive interface to input movie titles and receive recommendations.

---

## Datasets

* `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains detailed metadata on 5000 movies, including genres, keywords, and summaries.
* `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Includes cast and crew information corresponding to the movies.

---

## How It Works

* The system combines metadata and credits data to calculate content similarity between movies.
* Upon entering a movie title or user preference, it ranks similar films and returns a curated recommendation list.
* Recommendation logic is primarily implemented in the notebook, supported by backend code in `app.py`.

---

## Deployment

* The `Procfile` enables easy deployment on platforms like Heroku.
* Use `setup.sh` to configure environment dependencies during deployment.
